Nota: 
Integer Overflow 
- Going from a positive number to a negative number
- https://calc.penjee.com/
Integer Underflow
- opposite
Signedness errors 
- works with say an unsigned variable and that number we just assign it to a new signed variable and this happens because the programmer wasn't careful enough or didn't have the knowledge to know that their code was actually doing

Truncation
- Happen when we assign variables of a given size to variables that are lower in size
