Hacked! If you dont want me to upload my shell, do better at filtering!

```
<!-- seriously, dumb stuff:

$target_dir = "cvs/";
$target_file = $target_dir . basename($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["name"]);

if (!strpos($target_file, ".pdf")) {
  echo "Only PDF CVs are accepted.";
} else if (file_exists($target_file)) {
  echo "This CV has already been uploaded!";
} else if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["tmp_name"], $target_file)) {
  echo "Success! We will get back to you.";
} else {
  echo "Something went wrong :|";
}
