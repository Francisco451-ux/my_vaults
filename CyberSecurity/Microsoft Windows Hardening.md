## Services

Windows Services create and manage critical functions such as network connectivity, storage, memory, sound, user credentials, and data backup and runs automatically in the background. These services are managed by the Service Control Manager panel and divided into three categories, i.e. Local, Network & System. Many applications like browsers and anti-virus software can also run their services for a seamless user experience.

## Windows Registry

The Windows registry is a unified container database that stores configurational settings, essential keys and shared preferences for Windows and third-party applications. Usually, on the installation of most applications, it uses a registry editor for storing various states of the application. For example, suppose an application (malicious or normal) wants to execute itself during the computer boot-up process; In that case, it will store its entry in the Run & Run Once key.

Type `regedit` in the Run dialogue or taskbar search to access the registry editor.
