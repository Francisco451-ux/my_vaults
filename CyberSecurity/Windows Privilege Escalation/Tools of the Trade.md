## WinPEAS

WinPEAS can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/winPEAS).


## PrivescCheck
PrivescCheck can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/itm4n/PrivescCheck).

**Reminder**: To run PrivescCheck on the target system, you may need to bypass the execution policy restrictions. To achieve this, you can use the `Set-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet as shown below.

```shell-session
PS C:\> Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope process -Force
PS C:\> . .\PrivescCheck.ps1
PS C:\> Invoke-PrivescCheck
```

## WES-NG: Windows Exploit Suggester - Next Generation
WES-NG is a Python script that can be found and downloaded [here](https://github.com/bitsadmin/wesng).

Once installed, and before using it, type the `wes.py --update` command to update the database.
The script will **refer to the database it creates to check for missing patches** that can result in a vulnerability you can use to elevate your privileges on the target system.

To use the script, you will need to run the `systeminfo`Â command on the target system. Do not forget to direct the output to a .txt file you will need to move to your attacking machine.

```shell-session
wes.py systeminfo.txt
```

## Metasploit

If you already have a Meterpreter shell on the target system, you can use the `multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester` module to list vulnerabilities that may affect the target system and allow you to elevate your privileges on the target system.
